# A/B Testing

A/B Testing means analyzing two marketing strategies to choose the best marketing strategy that can convert more traffic into sales (or more traffic into your desired goal) effectively and efficiently.

In A/B testing, we analyze the results of two marketing strategies to choose the best one for future marketing campaigns. For example, when I started an ad campaign on Instagram to promote my Instagram post for the very first time, my target audience was different from the target audience of my second ad campaign. After analyzing the results of both ad campaigns, I always preferred the audience of the second ad campaign as it gave better reach and followers than the first one.

Our goal can be to boost sales, followers, or traffic, but when we choose the best marketing strategy according to the results of our previous marketing campaigns, it is nothing but A/B testing.

## The audience of the control campaign viewed more content than the test campaign. Although there is not much difference, as the website clicks of the control campaign were low, its engagement on the website is higher than the test campaign.


## Let's look at the number of products added to the cart from both campaigns

## The amount spent on the test campaign is higher than the control campaign. But as we can see that the control campaign resulted in more content views and more products in the cart, the control campaign is more efficient than the test campaign.



## Purchases made by both campaigns

## There’s only a difference of around 1% in the purchases made from both ad campaigns. As the Control campaign resulted in more sales in less amount spent on marketing, the control campaign wins here!



## Analyzing some metrics to find which ad campaign converts more. I will first look at the relationship between the number of website clicks and content viewed from both campaigns
![newplot (7)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67755812/212919727-ab055c22-4a43-41f6-a1ee-73a93cbcd2d4.png)

## The website clicks are higher in the test campaign, but the engagement from website clicks is higher in the control campaign. So the control campaign wins!



## Now will analyze the relationship between the amount of content viewed and the number of products added to the cart from both campaigns
![newplot (8)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67755812/212919864-ec1fca83-e22a-4ba4-8656-e4bb9993f6d6.png)

## Add to Cart are more in control campaign and engagement from website clicks are also higher in control campaign



## Let’s have a look at the relationship between the number of products added to the cart and the number of sales from both campaigns

## Although the control campaign resulted in more sales and more products in the cart, the conversation rate of the test campaign is higher

# Conclusion
From the above A/B tests, we found that the control campaign resulted in more sales and engagement from the visitors. More products were viewed from the control campaign, resulting in more products in the cart and more sales. But the conversation rate of products in the cart is higher in the test campaign. The test campaign resulted in more sales according to the products viewed and added to the cart. And the control campaign results in more sales overall. So, the Test campaign can be used to market a specific product to a specific audience, and the Control campaign can be used to market multiple products to a wider audience.
